# email-summer-sale-project

This is a quick-build HTML email I designed to show clean, responsive structure - something you might use for a product launch or seasonal sale.

It's built with plain HTML and CSS. No frameworks, just solid layout with real-world structure: headline, promo blurb, CTA, product blocks, and a footer.

## What it includes
- Hero image
- Bold headline + subtext
- Call-to-action button
- Two product features (image, name, price)
- Simple footer with brand and unsubscribe link

## Why I made it
I wanted a small, polished piece I could point to and say:  
“Yes, I can build that. Clean code, solid layout, mobile-ready.”

It’s the kind of email I’ve built in the past for campaigns — and now it lives here as a working example.

## How to View It
1. Download or clone this repo  
2. Open `Email_Project_Summer_Sale.html` in your browser  
3. Or paste the code into [Stripo](https://stripo.email) or [Litmus](https://www.litmus.com/) to test it in an email context
