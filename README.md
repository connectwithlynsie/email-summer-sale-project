# Summer Sale Email + Landing Page Build

This mini-project is all about going from concept to clean code - fast. I built this to keep my HTML/CSS skills sharp, show what I can do without frameworks, and practice shipping pixel-perfect, responsive work.

## What I Built

- A responsive HTML email - tested across desktop + mobile
- A matching landing page to extend the visual story
- Modular structure for easy reuse + updates

No frameworks. No fluff. Just HTML, CSS, and a little finesse.

## Why This?

I love building systems that are simple, fast, and effective. This is part of my portfolio of small-but-sharp projects focused on real-world frontend work — think email dev, marketing pages, and modular builds.
