# email-summer-sale-project

This is a quick-build HTML email I designed to show clean, responsive structure, something you might use for a product launch or seasonal sale.

It's built with plain HTML and CSS. No frameworks, just solid layout with real-world structure: headline, promo blurb, CTA, product blocks, and a footer.

## What it includes
- Hero image
- Bold headline + subtext
- Call-to-action button
- Two product features (image, name, price)
- Simple footer with brand and unsubscribe link

## Why I made it
